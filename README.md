# Mesto Project

## About:

This project was created as an educational practice for those who study HTML,
CSS and JS. This is a one-page website with adaptive layout. It allows you to open and close
the popup window, edit the profile, add new cards to the page and delete them.

The page is collapsed based on the `Figma` layout. The project was
created using `HTML`, `CSS` and `JS'.
